react-board-game-tracker

This is a work in progress project as I build out the front end for a board game tracker app to track board game collections, wishlists, plays and other stats

This is a for fun project for a hobby I enjoy; while having a real world use case in my board gaming group and I learn more about React and other tools

Eventually this will soon be implemented with the backend
